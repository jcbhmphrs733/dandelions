# 🌸 Dandelions: A Strategic Battle of Nature 🌪️

Welcome to **Dandelions**, an enchanting two-player puzzle game where the forces of nature clash in an epic botanical showdown! 

## The Story
In this whimsical digital battlefield, two ancient powers wage war across a mystical grid: the **Dandelions** 🌼 seek to spread their seeds far and wide, covering every inch of earth with their golden blooms, while the **Wind** 💨 fights back with fierce gusts, determined to scatter their carefully planted dreams.

## The Gameplay
- **Dandelion Player**: Your mission is to strategically place flowers across the grid and watch them bloom into a magnificent carpet of seeds
- **Wind Player**: Armed with eight directional wind bursts (North, South, East, West, Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, Southwest), you must cleverly time your gusts to prevent the dandelions from achieving total coverage
- **Eight Epic Rounds**: Each wind direction can only be used once per game, making every decision crucial and every round a nail-biting strategic choice

## How to Play

- **Left-click** on any grid cell to plant a seed directly 🌱
- **Middle-click** anywhere to clear the entire grid
- **Click compass directions** to blow wind and spread seeds from flowers

### Game Flow
1. Plant flowers strategically across the grid
2. Choose your wind direction wisely - you only get one use per direction!

4. Try to cover as much of the grid as possible with your dandelion empire
